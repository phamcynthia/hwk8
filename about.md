## About
I am a senior at the University of Oklahoma majoring in MIS; I chose that field of study because I’ve always been interested in computers and technology. One of my key accomplishments during my academic career was interning at a company where I helped K-12 schools obtain funding for their internet access. While I really enjoyed the work that I did, I’d love the chance to explore other options, which is why I have started applying for full-time positions. I am aiming to start building my career and challenging myself at my first job upon graduating college.
