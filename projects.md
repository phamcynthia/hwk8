## Projects

### Database project
The client for my databases class, La Cocina de la Abuela Taco Truck, is a local taco truck run in Norman that has asked for the help of OU students in order to build a database. Being a small company who traditionally recorded things on paper, they wanted to move their records into a more convenient online database. Thus, we were tasked with building a database for them, which would track various things. This includes customer and employee information, tip tracking, and more.

To do this, we first started by forming an ERD. This allowed us to see the things we needed to track (such as customer and employee information) as well as the relationships between those entities. Since the ERD was the foundation of our database, after we perfected our ERD, we were able to start building our SQL queries. We input these into the database so that our client could have access to the code and see how the outputs should look like. The SQL queries were essentially the final part of our database project since the code dictated how things were output and shown to the client â€“ this is the information they requested we convert for them.

I learned that in order to successfully work with a team, communication is key. In terms of technical skills, this project taught me SQL; I was able to utilize it in this project, as seen in some of the queries. I learned how to use the different statements of a query (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc.) as well as how to run those queries in an actual database.


### MIS 3033 Github Website
This website was created in order to showcase the skills I learned in the MIS 3033 programming class. This website displays my skillsets, projects I am proud of, as well as little blurbs and tidbits about what this site is about.
